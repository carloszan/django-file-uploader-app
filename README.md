File uploader powered by NextJs

### Functional

- Stores files of any type and name
- Stores files at any URL
- Does not allow interaction by non-authenticated users
- Does not allow a user to access files submitted by another user
- Allows users to store multiple revisions of the same file at the same URL
- Allows users to fetch any revision of any file

### Non-functional

- Demonstrate knowledge of best-practices in relation to unit testing
- Clear documentation detailing how to build and run the frontend and backend

### Example

A user may submit the file "review.pdf" to the application, specifying "/documents/reviews/review.pdf" as the desired URL. The user later submits a new version of the file at the same URL.
The user can now retrieve the latest version of the file by accessing the document URL ("/documents/reviews/review.pdf"). The original version of the file can be accessed at the URL ("/documents/reviews/review.pdf?revision=0").
